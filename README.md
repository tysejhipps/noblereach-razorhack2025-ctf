# Read Me For NWA RazorHack 2025

## 🦖 NobleReach Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Challenge 
*A storyline based off a noblereach scholar - game style Capture the Flag Experience*

## About This Project
In honor of RazorHack 2025, this Capture the Flag experience was recreated by Tyse Hipps to highlight the work of RazorHack. The original storyline was created by Evan Glover and served as the foundation for the introduction of our gold sponsor, NobleReach Foundation. This project is intended for use in future games and by future clubs.

This is an **interactive example** of a custom OSINT challenge created by the **RazorHack 2025** team for our gold sponsor, the **NobleReach Foundation**.
