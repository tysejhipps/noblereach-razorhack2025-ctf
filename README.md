# noblereach-razorhack2025-ctf
In honor of RazorHack 2025, this Capture the Flag experience was recreated by Tyse Hipps to highlight the work of RazorHack. The original storyline was created by Evan Glover and served as the foundation for the introduction of our gold sponsor, NobleReach Foundation. This project is intended for use in future games and by future clubs.
